Data and code for the publication: "Competitor-induced plasticity modifies the interactions and predicted competitive outcomes between annual plants"

Data is available in the two .csv files. "Plasticity.Data.Focals.v16.csv" contains fecundity data while "Plant.Pheno.data.June3.v2.csv" contains traits data.

The file "Functions.R" contains helper functions that are used throughout the project. The file "TraitAnalysis.R" analyzes the trait data. The remaining files all follow the same naming convention. 
First, we list the current model we are considering, then we list the action we are performing for that model. For example, "BevertonHolt_FitParameters.R" fits the parameters of the Beverton-Holt model.
Similarly, "BevertonHolt_PlotFits.R" plots these fits. This file creates most of the figures for the paper.
